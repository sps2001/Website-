<pre><h4>What is Amazon Prime?</h4>
         
    Amazon Prime is a subscription service from Amazon. It gives members access to exclusive shopping and entertainment services, discounts and more.
    
<h4>How much does an Amazon Prime membership cost?</h4>

    The cost of an Amazon Prime membership depends on the plan you choose, but you can try it for free for 30 days.
    
    Here’s a breakdown of the payment plans and what they include:
    
    Prime Video: $8.99 per month. This membership restricts your perks to unlimited TV show and movie streaming. It’ll cost you around $108 per year.
    
    Prime: $12.99 per month. If you want full Prime benefits but prefer to spread out your payments, you’ll pay about $155 a year. If you receive qualifying government assistance, you can get a Prime membership for $5.99 per month.
    
    Prime: $119 per year. Those who pay an annual lump sum for the full membership will spend less in the long run.
    
    Prime Student: If you’re a student with a valid school email address, you can get a free six-month trial of Prime Student and a discounted membership fee of $59 per year (or $6.49 per month) after that.
    
    Heads up: Amazon keeps your credit card information on file when you sign up, so if you decide you don’t want the membership once your free trial expires, make sure to log into your account and cancel it. Otherwise, you’ll be charged the membership fee.
    
    <h4>Is Amazon Prime worth it?</h4>
    Whether Prime’s membership perks justify the price tag depends on which ones appeal to you and how much you use them. Let’s start by evaluating two of Prime's biggest draws: shipping and streaming entertainment.
    
    Shipping. If you spent more than $119 in shipping fees last year, well, there’s your answer.
    
    Streaming entertainment. Amazon Prime, which includes Prime Video, is cheaper than both the commercial-free Hulu plan and the standard Netflix plan. Prime also includes Amazon Music Prime, which is about the same price as ad-free subscriptions to Spotify and Apple Music. If the video and music selection is wide enough that you’d consider forgoing a subscription to other services, you’ll recoup the cost of Amazon Prime.
    
    There are other considerations to take into account, such as the convenience of having your items shipped in days instead of weeks, or not having to go to the store to buy essentials like paper towels.
    
    Keep in mind, too, that you can share your shipping benefits with another household member. If you split the cost with a roommate, for example, you can effectively cut the cost down to under $60 a year — a pretty amazing deal. Free two-day shipping for less than $5 a month is well worth it for most shoppers.
    
    The best way to figure out if an Amazon Prime membership is worthwhile: Sign up for the free trial. Then, you can decide whether to make the investment.
