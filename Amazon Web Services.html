    <pre><h2>What is Cloud Computing?</h2> 
        Cloud computing is a term referred to storing and accessing data over the internet. It doesn’t store any data on the hard disk of your personal computer. In cloud computing, you can access 
        
        data from a remote server.
        <h4>Types of cloud computing</h4>
The three main types of cloud computing include Infrastructure as a Service, Platform as a Service, and Software as a Service. Each type of cloud computing provides different levels of control, 

flexibility, and management so that you can select the right set of services for your needs.
 
<h4>IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)</h4>
IaaS contains the basic building blocks for cloud IT. It typically provides access to networking features, computers (virtual or on dedicated hardware), and data storage space. IaaS gives you the 

highest level of flexibility and management control over your IT resources. It is most similar to the existing IT resources with which many IT departments and developers are familiar.
 
<h4>PaaS(Platform as a Service)</h4>
PaaS removes the need for you to manage underlying infrastructure (usually hardware and operating systems) , and allows you to focus on the deployment and management of your applications.

This helps you be more efficient as you don’t need to worry about resource procurement, capacity planning, software maintenance, patching, or any of the other undifferentiated heavy lifting 

involved in running your application.
 
<h4>SaaS(Software as a Service)</h4>
SaaS provides you with a complete product that is run and managed by the service provider. In most cases, people referring to SaaS are referring to end-user applications (such as web-based email).

With a SaaS offering, you don’t have to think about how the service is maintained or how the underlying infrastructure is managed. You only need to think about how you will use that particular software.

<h2>What is Amazon Web Services (AWS)?</h2>

AWS (Amazon Web Services) is a comprehensive, evolving cloud computing platform provided by Amazon that includes a mixture of infrastructure as a service (IaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), and packaged software as a service (SaaS) offerings.

AWS services can offer an organization tools such as compute power, database storage, and content delivery services.

AWS launched in 2006 from the internal infrastructure that Amazon.com built to handle its online retail operations. 

AWS was one of the first companies to introduce a pay-as-you-go cloud computing model that scales to provide users with computing, storage, or throughput as needed.

AWS offers many different tools and solutions for enterprises and software developers that can be used in data centers in up to 190 countries.

Groups such as government agencies, education institutions, nonprofits, and private organizations can use AWS services.


<h4>History of AWS</h4>
Amazon launched its first cloud computing service, Simple Storage Service (S3), in March of 2006. But the idea for the public cloud began germinating at the company several years earlier.

A popular myth says that Amazon began selling public cloud computing services because it had “excess capacity” from running its eCommerce website. Executives have repeatedly contradicted that story, saying that Amazon Web Services was designed from the ground up as a service for outside customers. However, the company’s experiences with eCommerce did help lay the groundwork for AWS.

In the early 2000s, Amazon.com’s internal development team had a problem. They were adding a lot of software engineers, but despite the growing headcount, the pace of development was staying about the same. The issue was that each developer was setting up new and unique compute, storage and database resources for each project. The IT group realized that if they could standardize those resources and simplify the process of deploying new IT infrastructure, they might be able to speed things up.

In 2003, former Amazon employee Benjamin Black and his boss Chris Pinkham wrote a paper for Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos. It described “a vision for Amazon infrastructure that was completely standardized, completely automated, and relied extensively on web services for things like storage.” In a blog post, Black explained, “Near the end of it, we mentioned the possibility of selling virtual servers as a service.”

That idea cropped up again that same year when Amazon executives were attending a retreat at Bezos’ house. As current AWS CEO Andy Jassy tells the story, the group was working to identify their core competencies when they realized they had become pretty good at running IT infrastructure. They began to consider the idea of offering those IT services to other companies. The idea gained momentum, and in 2004, Black, Pinkham, and their team began work on the project that eventually became AWS. After the launch of S3 in the spring of 2006, AWS followed up by taking its Simple Queue Service into production and launching its Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) that summer. By the following year, the company amassed a reported 180,000 developers as customers by the following year.

In the years that followed, Amazon’s cloud quickly expanded with additional services and more regions. In 2010, Netflix became the first company to announce publicly that it would run all of its infrastructure on AWS. After that, customers began to sign up even more quickly, and AWS developed the market share that put it far ahead of all the other competitors who began to offer their own cloud computing services.
 
<h4>Some important years</h4>
2002- AWS services launched
2006- Launched its cloud products
2012- Holds first customer event
2015- Reveals revenues achieved of $4.6 billion
2016- Surpassed $10 billion revenue target
2016- Release snowball and snowmobile
2019- Offers nearly 100 cloud services
2021- AWS comprises over 200 products and services

<h2>Important AWS Services</h2>
Amazon Web Services offers a wide range of different business purposes global cloud-based products. The products include storage, databases, analytics, networking, mobile, development tools, enterprise applications, with a pay-as-you-go pricing model.

<h4>AWS Compute Services</h4>
The Cloud Compute Services offered by Amazon:

<b>EC2(Elastic Compute Cloud)</b> - 

EC2 is a virtual machine in the cloud on which you have OS-level control. You can run this cloud server whenever you want.

<b>LightSail</b> - 

This cloud computing tool automatically deploys and manages the computer, storage, and networking capabilities required to run your applications.

<b>Elastic Beanstalk</b> - 

The tool offers automated deployment and provisioning of resources like a highly scalable production website.

<b>EKS (Elastic Container Service for Kubernetes)</b> - 

The tool allows you to Kubernetes on Amazon cloud environment without installation.

<b>AWS Lambda</b> - 

This AWS service allows you to run functions in the cloud. The tool is a big cost-saver for you as you pay only when your functions execute.
